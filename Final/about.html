                    <p>My name is Jeremy Kirkpatrick. I am a 28 year old male from Sioux Falls, SD.
                        I grew up in Brandon, South Dakota and spent a good chunk of my childhood playing basketball.
                        Currently, I am employeed full-time at Qualified Presort Services. I'm the head of transportation and chief of building security.
                        I've been blessed with one amazing son, and one daughter. Lucky me!
                        This is my first year at Southeast Technical College. I previously attended Southeast Technical Institute in 2014!

                    <p>I entered into fatherhood a little under 6 years ago. I was bestowed a son first, perfect health. Hes goofy, and he just started kindergarden.
                        Next month is his 6th birthday and he is very excited.
                        Next came my daughter she is a little over 2. She was diagnosed with CMV (Cytomegalovirus) while in the womb.
                        Her name is Octavia, she was named after an actress off the netflix show "The 100". In the series she was a second born that wasn't meant to be that was raised
                        to become a fierce fighter and leader. My daughter defeated all odds and has come out unscathed from the virus. She is our little miracle.
