                <h2>Project 1 - Basic Web Design</h2>
                <p>This was our first big assignment from our instructor. It was putting together a website with basic web design.
                    In this unit I learned the basics, how to put together an html page, how to link pages, and how to post to gitHub!

                <h2>Project 2 - Responsive Web Design </h2>
                <p>In this project, I developed a website that had responsive design. Shown alongside it is the source code.
                    In this portion of the course we learned how to make items respond to user input on the website. We also learned how to make items move!

                <h2>Project 3</h2>
                <p>This was our first team project. My partner and I put together a mock website for a Space Convention. 
                    It included an invite form that I put together along with help from my partner. We also included an AFrame of Space!
                    My partner taught me alot about AFrames during our time we spent working together.
                    This chapter was big on Virtual Reality and it was a blast.</p>
