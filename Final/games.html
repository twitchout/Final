                        You follow the story of Peter Parker and help the NYPD defeat his villians.
                        My son and I have both become very enthralled with this game recently.

                    <h2>Minecraft</h2>
                    <p>How do you explain Minecraft? It is an open world survival game where every piece of the world is interactive. It is styled after 8 bit cubes.
                        It is a fun and interactive game that you can play with friends or tiny children. My 6 year old son loves this game. 
                        He can probably tell you more about this game then me.</p>
